Data Analysis Project for RedWood Dataset

Files to look at:

1. Writeup file: project1_writeup.Rmd

This is the file generating the final report and has the cleanest code possible.

2. Code Development file: project1_code.Rmd

This is the file used for development and contains almost all the code.
